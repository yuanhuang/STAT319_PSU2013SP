<p class="normal">The purpose of the reading is to help you get more sense about how statistics are applied.   I don't require you to understand every piece of mathematics contents in the paper.  However, I do require you to understand what the procedures are taken to tackle a problem in statistics.  For each of the paper, I will give detail instruction about how to read the paper.  And I will give less instruction later when I think it's time for you to determine what the important content is. I probably will assign the same reading a second round if you have more knowledge to understand some more bit of content as the course going on.  </p>

<p class="normal">For each paper,</p>

<p class="normal">
Read it ! Study it! Get to know it! Take notes of it!   Learn how to summarize the statistical ideas it contains! Discuss with your classmates! Put it under your pillow at night if you have to! (from our Prof. Hunter)

<b>Get articles: </b> You can obtain these articles online through the Penn State library site: Go to <a class="small" href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/home.html">http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/home.html </a> and click on the E-journals link. Then type in the journal name. When the list of journals appears, find the journal we need. Click its title or the "get it" button, at which point you'll be asked for the year, volume, issue, and start page of the article.  Sometimes, you can directly search the journal by type in the name in Google search and download it when you are in the campus.
