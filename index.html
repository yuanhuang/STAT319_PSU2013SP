<tr><td align=right valign=top><b>Grading</b></td>
<td width=900>There will be two midterms (15% each), a comprehensive final
exam (30%), homework (25%), quizzes (15%). Final semester grades are assigned according to the scale:

<table class="center">
<tr>
 <td> 93 - 100% &nbsp; &nbsp;A </td>  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </td>

Use for grades before April 1st. </span>   </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   <a  href=" cal_max/scoreCalc.html"  target="_blank"> <span style="color:#008000;"> 2. The amazingly comprehensive version.  </span></a> 


<ul>
<li><b>Homework</b>

Homework is due <font color="#ff0000">by the beginning of class</font>  on its due date. Unless you inform TA at least 24 hours before homework is due about any extenuating circumstances, late homework will not be accepted. Late work is penalized 10% and accepted only if solutions have not been posted. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I will drop one lowest homework.</FONT>
<br>
Solutions for each assignment will be posted on Angel, typically by the time the homework is returned to you. Homework will usually be returned within one week from the due date. </li>
 
<li><b>Quizzes</b> Randomly timed, in-class quizzes will be given.  Such a quiz might be announced or unannounced. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">No</FONT> make-up quizzes will be given for any reason. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">However, I will drop three lowest quizzes.</FONT></li>

<li><b>Exams</b>  There will be two midterm exams on dates to be announced.  The second midterm will not be comprehensive; i.e., it will cover only the period of time between the two midterms. If you must miss any midterm, you should provide a valid reason IN WRITING to the instructor 48 hours PRIOR TO the midterm. If you have to miss a midterm at the last minute for some reason, be sure to notify the instructor prior to the midterm time by email; in these cases, you should later back up your excuse with written documentation.  An unexcused absence on an midterm date will result in a score of 0.
    <br>
     The comprehensive final exam will take place at the registrar-designated time
and place during the week of April 29 - May 3. Unlike the midterms, it will cover the entire semester and not merely the period after the second midterm. <b>No rescheduled final exams will be allowed except for those mandated by the Penn State registrar because of conflicts.</b>  This means that you must attend the final exam and should under no circumstances make end-of-semester travel arrangements before knowing your final exam schedule.  </li>
</ul>

<B>OTHER GRADING NOTES:</B>
<ul>

<li>Solution sets for the homeworks will be provided; login to the course ANGEL page to access them.
You are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to
learn how to do any homework problems you had trouble with, either by
<font color="#ff0000">reading the solutions,
discussing them with colleagues
in the course, or asking questions of the grader or me.</font>  This is especially important in this
course, where solving problems is absolutely essential to learn the material.
I am happy to devote some class time to answering homework questions as necessary.
<li>Don't overlook office hours (mine or the grader's) as a great opportunity to discuss homework,
both past and present.  You do not need an appointment to show up to office hours; simply walk in!
